# Lighting Gradient

The Lighting Gradient augmentation produces a decayed light mask generated by a light strip given position and direction, and applies it to the image as a lighting or brightness gradient.

**Example Usage:**

```python
augmentation = LightingGradient(
	light_position=None,
	direction=None,
	max_brightness=255,
	min_brightness=0,
	mode="gaussian",
	linear_decay_rate=None,
	transparency=None,
	p=0.5
    )
```

| Parameter | Description |
|---|---|
| `light_position` | Tuple of integers (x, y) specifying the center of light strip position, which is the reference point during rotating. |
| `direction` | Integer from 0 to 360 specifying the rotation degree of light strip. |
| `max_brightness` | Specifies the max brightness in the mask. |
| `min_brightness` | Specifies the min brightness in the mask. |
| `mode` | Specifies the way that brightness decays from max to min: linear or gaussian. |
| `linear_decay_rate` | Only valid in linear_static mode. Suggested value is within [0.2, 2] |
| `transparency` | Specifies the transparency used by the generated mask, value range of 0 to 1. |
| `p` | The probability that this augmentation will be applied. |
